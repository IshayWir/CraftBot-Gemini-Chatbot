# Watercolor Materials Guide

## Paper

### Paper Weight
**What the numbers mean:** Paper weight is measured in pounds (lb) or grams per square meter (gsm).

**90 lb / 190 gsm** - Very thin, will buckle significantly  
❌ Not recommended for watercolor

**140 lb / 300 gsm** - Standard watercolor paper  
✅ **BEST for beginners** - Thick enough to handle water without severe buckling, affordable

**300 lb / 640 gsm** - Premium thick paper  
✅ Minimal buckling, doesn't need stretching, but expensive

**Recommendation for beginners:** Start with 140 lb paper. It's the sweet spot of quality and affordability.

### Paper Texture

**Hot Press (Smooth)**
- Very smooth surface
- Paint glides easily
- **Best for:** Detailed work, scanning, illustrations
- **Challenges:** Less forgiving, harder to lift paint

**Cold Press (Medium Texture)**
- Slight texture, most popular
- **Best for:** General watercolor work, all techniques
- **Most versatile** - great for beginners
- ✅ **START HERE**

**Rough**
- Very textured surface
- Creates interesting effects
- **Best for:** Loose, expressive work, landscapes
- **Challenges:** Hard to get fine details

---

### Paper Brands

**Budget-Friendly (Great for practice):**
- **Canson XL** - Very affordable, decent quality
- **Strathmore 400 Series** - Good student grade
- **Arteza** - Budget option, inconsistent but okay for learning

**Mid-Range (Excellent for beginners):**
- **Arches** - Industry standard, excellent quality
- **Fabriano Artistico** - Professional quality, slightly cheaper than Arches
- **Saunders Waterford** - Good quality, reliable

**Where to save money:** Buy pads instead of blocks, or buy large sheets and cut them yourself

---

### Paper Forms

**Pads** - Sheets glued on one edge, easy to remove  
**Blocks** - Glued on all four sides, prevents buckling  
**Sheets** - Large individual sheets, most economical (cut to size)

**For beginners:** Pads are easiest. Blocks are worth it if you have the budget.

## Paints

### Paint Quality Levels

**Student Grade**
- Less pigment, more filler
- Colors may be less vibrant
- Good for learning and practice
- Much more affordable
- ✅ **Perfect for beginners**

**Artist/Professional Grade**
- Higher pigment concentration
- More vibrant, transparent colors
- Better lightfastness (won't fade)
- More expensive
- Better once you know what you're doing

**Recommendation:** Start with student grade. Upgrade to artist grade once you know which colors you use most.

---

### Paint Forms

**Tubes**
- Wet, concentrated paint
- Good for mixing large quantities
- Can dry out if not sealed
- **Best for:** Larger paintings, lots of mixing

**Pans (Half-pans or Full Pans)**
- Dried paint in small containers
- Portable, convenient
- Rewet with water to use
- **Best for:** Traveling, small paintings, convenience

## Brushes

### Brush Shapes

**Round Brushes** - Most versatile, pointed tip  
✅ **ESSENTIAL** - Start here. Sizes 4, 8, and 12 cover most needs.

**Flat Brushes** - Square edge, good for washes and sharp edges  
Useful but not essential for beginners

**Mop Brushes** - Large, holds lots of water, great for washes  
Nice to have eventually

**Rigger/Liner** - Very thin, long bristles for fine lines  
Optional, useful for details

---

### Brush Sizes

Numbers indicate size (bigger number = bigger brush)

**Recommended starter set:**
- **Size 4 or 6** - Small details
- **Size 8 or 10** - Medium work (most versatile)
- **Size 12 or 14** - Larger areas, washes

You can paint almost anything with just these three sizes.

---

### Brush Hair Types

**Synthetic** - Man-made fibers  
- Affordable
- Durable, easy to clean
- Good spring and shape retention
- ✅ **Perfect for beginners**

**Natural (Sable, Squirrel, etc.)** - Animal hair  
- Expensive
- Superior water holding
- Softer, more control
- Professional choice

**Blend** - Mix of synthetic and natural  
- Good compromise
- Better than pure synthetic, cheaper than pure natural

**For beginners:** Quality synthetic brushes work great. Save money here.

---

### Brush Care

- **Rinse thoroughly** after each session
- **Never leave standing in water** (damages ferrule and bristles)
- **Reshape tips** while wet
- **Lay flat or stand bristle-up** to dry
- **Use gentle brush soap** occasionally

---

## Additional Supplies

3. **Quality synthetic brushes** - Almost as good as natural at 1/5 the price
4. **Use household items** - Jars for water, plates for palettes, salt for texture
5. **Buy a few good supplies** rather than lots of cheap ones
6. **Take care of your tools** - They'll last years
7. **Watch for sales** - Art supply stores have frequent discounts
8. **Online retailers** - Often cheaper than brick-and-mortar

---

## What to Prioritize

If you have limited budget, spend money in this order:

1. **Good paper** (140lb minimum) - Makes the biggest difference
2. **Basic paint set** (6-12 colors, student grade is fine)
3. **Three good brushes** (synthetic rounds)
4. Everything else can wait

## Where to Buy

**Online (Usually Cheapest):**
- Dick Blick / Blick Art Materials
- Jerry's Artarama
- Amazon (read reviews carefully)
- Cheap Joe's Art Stuff

**In-Person:**
- Local art supply stores (support local!)
- Michaels / Hobby Lobby (use coupons!)
- Chain bookstores (small selection but convenient)

---

## Testing Before You Buy

If possible:
- **Feel the paper** - Should feel substantial, not flimsy
- **Check paint pigment info** - Good paints list actual pigments
- **Hold brushes** - Should feel comfortable in your hand
- **Read reviews** - Especially for beginner-specific recommendations

---

## Remember

**You don't need expensive supplies to create beautiful art.** Many professional artists use student-grade materials. What matters most is practice and technique. Start with basics, learn what you actually use, then upgrade gradually based on your specific needs and style.

The best materials are the ones you'll actually use, not the ones that intimidate you to start.
