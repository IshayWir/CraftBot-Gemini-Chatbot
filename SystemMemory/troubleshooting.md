# Watercolor Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Muddy Colors

### What it looks like:
Colors look dull, grayish, or brownish instead of vibrant and clear.

### Common causes:
- Mixing too many colors together
- Mixing complementary colors in wrong proportions
- Dirty water or brush
- Overworking wet paint
- Using too many layers

### Solutions:

**Prevention:**
- **Limit your palette** to 3-5 colors per painting
- **Mix only 2-3 colors** together maximum
- **Change water frequently** - murky water = muddy colors
- **Clean brush between colors** - rinse thoroughly
- **Let layers dry completely** before adding more

**Color mixing strategy:**
- Mix colors deliberately on your palette first
- Test mixes on scrap paper before applying
- Use more of one color, less of another (avoid 50/50 mixes of complements)

**If it's already muddy:**
- Let it dry and glaze over with a fresh, clean color
- Embrace it as a neutral background
- Consider it a learning experience for next time

## Problem: Paper Buckling/Warping

### What it looks like:
Paper waves, wrinkles, or forms hills and valleys when wet.

### Common causes:
- Paper too thin (less than 140lb)
- Too much water on paper
- Not securing paper to surface
- Not stretching paper (for large washes)

### Solutions:

**For 140lb paper:**
- **Tape all four edges** with masking tape or painter's tape before starting
- Work on a board or rigid surface
- Apply water more evenly and sparingly
- Accept minor buckling (it flattens somewhat as it dries)

**For thinner paper:**
- **Stretch your paper:**
  1. Soak paper in water (2-3 minutes)
  2. Place on board
  3. Tape or staple all edges
  4. Let dry completely before painting
- Or switch to heavier paper (300lb)

**Emergency fixes:**
- Place dried painting under heavy books overnight
- Iron on lowest setting (put cloth between iron and paper)
- Spray back of paper lightly with water, press flat under weight

**Long-term:**
- Invest in 300lb paper (no buckling)
- Use watercolor blocks (glued on all sides)
- Tape paper edges before starting

## Problem: Paint Won't Lift/Remove

### What it looks like:
When you try to lift paint with water and tissue, the color won't budge.

### Common causes:
- Staining pigments (some colors stain more than others)
- Paint has dried too long
- Wrong paper surface (hot press lifts easier than rough)
- Scrubbing too gently

### Solutions:

**Know your pigments:**
- **Staining colors** (hard to lift): Alizarin Crimson, Phthalo Blue/Green, many modern pigments
- **Non-staining** (lift easily): Ultramarine Blue, Burnt Sienna, Cerulean Blue

**Lifting technique:**
1. Wet the area with clean water
2. Wait 30-60 seconds for paint to reactivate
3. Blot with paper towel or tissue
4. Repeat if needed
5. Use soft scrubbing with brush if necessary

**For stubborn stains:**
- Use a **scrubber brush** (stiff bristles designed for lifting)
- Try a **Mr. Clean Magic Eraser** (very gently)
- Accept the stain and work around it
- Paint over with opaque white gouache for highlights

**Prevention:**
- Choose non-staining pigments when you need to preserve lift-ability
- Lift while paint is still damp (much easier)
- Use masking fluid for areas you want to keep white

## Problem: Harsh, Visible Brushstrokes

### What it looks like:
Can see every individual brushstroke; painting looks choppy or streaky instead of smooth.

### Common causes:
- Not enough water
- Working on dry paper when you need wet
- Brush too dry
- Paint drying too fast
- Reworking areas as they dry

### Solutions:

**For smooth washes:**
- Use **more water** than you think you need
- Work **wet-on-wet** for smooth blends
- Keep a **puddle of paint** on your palette
- Reload brush frequently
- Work quickly before paint dries
- **Tilt your board** slightly to let paint flow

**For gradients:**
- Mix enough paint before starting (don't mix mid-wash)
- Use large brush
- Overlap strokes while wet
- Never go back over drying areas

**If brushstrokes are already visible:**
- **Option 1:** Embrace them as texture and style
- **Option 2:** Let dry completely, wet entire area, add unified glaze on top
- **Option 3:** Use spray bottle to soften edges while still damp

**When brushstrokes are good:**
- For texture (tree bark, grass, fur)
- Expressive, loose style
- Final details and accents

## Problem: Colors Bleeding Where They Shouldn't

### What it looks like:
Colors flow into each other uncontrollably, creating unwanted blends or fuzzy edges.

### Common causes:
- Paper or adjacent paint still too wet
- Too much water in brush
- Painting too close to wet areas
- High humidity in room

### Solutions:

**Prevention:**
- **Wait for areas to dry** before painting adjacent areas
- Use a **hair dryer on cool** to speed drying
- **Blot excess water** from brush before applying
- Leave small gaps between areas, fill in later when dry
- Work on one section at a time

**When you want crisp edges:**
1. Make sure paper is completely dry
2. Use less water in your brush
3. Use wet-on-dry technique
4. Consider using masking tape for hard edges

**When you want soft edges:**
1. Wet one side of your shape
2. Paint into the wet area
3. Let it naturally feather and blend

**If colors are already bleeding:**
- **Quick action:** Blot immediately with tissue
- **Slow approach:** Let it dry, assess if it's actually a problem
- **Embrace it:** Soft blends can be beautiful
- **Cover it:** Add darker color once dry

## Problem: Painting Looks Washed Out or Too Light

### What it looks like:
Everything looks pale, lacks depth, colors seem weak.

### Common causes:
- Too much water, not enough pigment
- Not building up enough layers
- Watercolors dry lighter than they look wet
- Being too timid with color

### Solutions:

**Mix stronger colors:**
- Use **more pigment, less water** in your mix
- Colors should look almost too dark on palette
- Test on scrap - watercolor dries 30% lighter

**Build up layers (glazing):**
1. Paint first layer, let dry completely
2. Add second layer to deepen
3. Continue until you reach desired depth
4. Darkest darks may need 3-5 layers

**Add contrast:**
- Every painting needs darks (don't fear them!)
- Add dark accents last for punch
- Squint at your painting - if everything looks the same value, add darks

**Mix darker darks:**
- Complementary colors mixed = rich darks
- Ultramarine Blue + Burnt Sienna = beautiful dark
- Don't rely on black alone

**Remember:**
- It's easier to darken than lighten
- But being too timid creates weak paintings
- Practice with strong colors on scrap paper

## Problem: Hard Edges / "Cauliflower" Effect

### What it looks like:
Unwanted hard lines or flower-shaped marks where paint dried unevenly.

### Common causes:
- Adding wet paint to damp (not wet, not dry) paper
- Water drops falling on damp paint
- Going back into semi-dry areas
- Inconsistent wetness of paper

### Solutions:

**Understanding the timing:**
- **Very wet paper:** Paint flows freely, soft edges
- **Damp paper:** DANGER ZONE - causes blooms
- **Dry paper:** Crisp, controlled edges

**Prevention:**
- Work wet-on-wet OR wet-on-dry, not in between
- Don't add water/paint to areas that are drying
- If you must touch drying area, wet entire section first
- Keep consistent wetness across section

**If it happens:**
- **Quick fix:** Immediately wet entire area, re-blend
- **Let it dry:** Sometimes blooms add interesting texture
- **Cover it:** Add another layer once completely dry
- **Embrace it:** Many artists love this effect intentionally

**Using it intentionally:**
- Purposely drop water into damp paint for texture
- Great for foliage, clouds, abstract effects
- Called "blooms" or "blossoms" when done on purpose

## Problem: Can't Get Fine Details

### What it looks like:
Lines are too thick, details too clumsy, can't control the brush.

### Common causes:
- Brush too large
- Too much water on brush
- Brush not coming to a point
- Old, damaged brush
- Wrong paper texture

### Solutions:

**Use right tools:**
- **Small round brush** (size 0-4) for details
- **Rigger/liner brush** for thin lines
- Ensure brush comes to fine point when wet

**Control water:**
- **Less water** = more control
- Blot brush slightly on paper towel
- Load paint, not just water

**Technique:**
- **Use just the tip** of the brush
- Hold brush more upright
- Brace hand on paper for stability
- Paint details on dry paper (wet-on-dry)

**When to add details:**
- **Last** - after all washes are dry
- Use fairly dry brush
- Work slowly and deliberately

**Paper matters:**
- Hot press or cold press better for details than rough
- Smooth paper = easier fine lines

## Problem: Paint Dries Too Fast

### What it looks like:
Can't blend colors, hard edges everywhere, feels rushed.

### Common causes:
- Low humidity
- Hot environment
- Thin paper drying quickly
- Working too slowly
- Not enough water

### Solutions:

**Extend working time:**
- **Spray paper** with water bottle before starting
- Use **more water** in mixes
- Work in cooler room
- Use humidifier (helps in dry climates)
- Work on watercolor block (retains moisture better)

**Technique adjustments:**
- Work **smaller sections** at a time
- Mix all colors **before** starting
- Have everything ready to go
- Work **faster** (practice will help)
- Use **larger brush** (holds more water)

**Paper choices:**
- **Heavier paper** (300lb) stays wet longer
- **Cotton paper** (not wood pulp) has better timing
- Avoid hot press (dries fastest)

## Problem: Runs and Drips

### What it looks like:
Paint runs down page creating unwanted streaks and drips.

### Common causes:
- Board tilted too much
- Too much water on paper
- Gravity!

### Solutions:

**Prevention:**
- Work on **flat or slightly tilted** surface
- Control **water amount**
- Keep paper towel handy to blot excess

**When to use tilt:**
- Graded washes (slight tilt helps paint flow)
- Let colors blend and move
- Purposeful drips for style

**Fixing drips:**
- **While wet:** Blot immediately with tissue
- **After dry:** May have to embrace it or paint over
- Add more drips to make it look intentional

## General Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Test first** - Always try technique on scrap paper
2. **Wait between layers** - Most problems come from impatience
3. **More water than you think** - Watercolor needs water
4. **Less color than you think** - Builds in layers
5. **Clean tools** - Dirty brushes/water create problems
6. **Accept imperfection** - It's watercolor's charm
7. **Learn from mistakes** - Every "failure" teaches something
8. **Keep practicing** - Control comes with repetition

---

## When to Call It Done (or Give Up)

**It's okay to:**
- Stop when you're frustrated
- Start over with fresh paper
- Set it aside and return tomorrow
- Accept "done enough" instead of perfect
- Learn the lesson and move on

**Every painting doesn't have to be a masterpiece. Some are just practice.**

## Remember

Watercolor is a forgiving medium in some ways, unforgiving in others. The key is learning when to fight it and when to flow with it. Most "mistakes" teach you more than perfect paintings ever will. Keep showing up, keep painting, keep learning from what doesn't work.
