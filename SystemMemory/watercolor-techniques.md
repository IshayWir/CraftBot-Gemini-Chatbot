# Watercolor Techniques Guide

## Basic Techniques

### Wet-on-Wet
**Description:** Applying wet paint to wet paper, allowing colors to blend and flow naturally.

**When to use:** 
- Soft, dreamy backgrounds
- Skies and clouds
- Water reflections
- Organic blending effects

**Step-by-step:**
1. Wet your paper thoroughly with clean water using a large brush or sponge
2. Tilt your paper slightly to see the sheen - it should be evenly damp
3. While the paper is still wet, load your brush with paint
4. Touch the brush to the paper and watch the color spread
5. Add additional colors while wet to create natural blends

**Common mistakes:**
- Paper drying too quickly (work faster or re-wet)
- Too much water creating puddles (blot with tissue)
- Colors bleeding too much (use less water)

### Wet-on-Dry
**Description:** Applying wet paint to completely dry paper for controlled, crisp edges.

**When to use:**
- Details and defined shapes
- Layering (glazing)
- Precise control over placement
- Sharper edges and lines

**Step-by-step:**
1. Ensure your paper is completely dry
2. Load your brush with paint (moderate water-to-paint ratio)
3. Apply paint with confidence in deliberate strokes
4. Let dry completely before adding another layer

**Common mistakes:**
- Going back over damp paint (creates muddy edges)
- Using too much water (edges will feather)
- Scrubbing the paper (damages surface)

### Dry Brush
**Description:** Using a brush with minimal water to create textured, broken strokes.

**When to use:**
- Texture (tree bark, grass, rough surfaces)
- Adding final details
- Creating contrast with smooth washes
- Suggesting form and dimension

**Step-by-step:**
1. Load your brush with paint
2. Dab brush on paper towel to remove excess moisture
3. Drag brush lightly across dry paper surface
4. Use the side of the brush for best texture

**Common mistakes:**
- Too much water (loses the broken texture effect)
- Pressing too hard (should be light and skipping)
- Using on wrong paper (works best on textured cold-press)

### Glazing (Layering)
**Description:** Applying thin, transparent layers of color over completely dry paint.

**When to use:**
- Building depth and luminosity
- Adjusting colors and values
- Creating rich, complex colors
- Adding shadows

**Step-by-step:**
1. Let your first layer dry COMPLETELY (15-30 minutes)
2. Mix a transparent wash (more water, less pigment)
3. Apply gently in one smooth stroke
4. Avoid going back over the same area
5. Let dry before adding additional layers

**Common mistakes:**
- Painting over damp layers (lifts previous layer)
- Too much pigment (becomes opaque, not transparent)
- Scrubbing (disturbs previous layer)

### Lifting
**Description:** Removing paint from paper to lighten areas or create highlights.

**When to use:**
- Creating clouds
- Adding highlights to water
- Correcting mistakes
- Creating texture and light effects

**Step-by-step:**
1. For wet lifting: blot damp paint with tissue or sponge
2. For dry lifting: wet the area with clean water and wait 30 seconds
3. Gently blot or scrub with paper towel or damp brush
4. Repeat if needed, but be gentle

**Common mistakes:**
- Scrubbing too hard (damages paper)
- Not waiting long enough when lifting dried paint
- Using low-quality paper (won't lift well)

### Graded Wash
**Description:** Creating a smooth transition from dark to light.

**When to use:**
- Skies
- Background gradients
- Creating depth
- Smooth color transitions

**Step-by-step:**
1. Tilt your board slightly (15-20 degrees)
2. Load brush with paint and create a stripe across the top
3. Quickly add clean water to your brush
4. Pull the paint down, diluting as you go
5. Continue adding water and pulling down until you reach light area

**Common mistakes:**
- Working too slowly (paint dries with hard edges)
- Not enough water on brush
- Going back over drying areas

---

### Salt Texture
**Description:** Sprinkling salt on wet paint to create organic, crystalline textures.

**When to use:**
- Starry skies
- Snow effects
- Texture in foliage
- Organic, unpredictable patterns

**Step-by-step:**
1. Apply paint to paper (should be fairly wet but not puddling)
2. While paint is still damp (not too wet, not too dry), sprinkle salt
3. Let dry completely without disturbing
4. Brush away salt crystals once fully dry

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding salt when paint is too wet (minimal effect)
- Adding salt when paint is too dry (no effect)
- Using too much salt (overwhelming texture)

## Advanced Techniques

### Splattering
Creating texture and energy by flicking paint onto paper. Use for stars, texture, or spontaneous effects.

### Masking
Using masking fluid or tape to preserve white areas before painting.

### Blending
Softening edges where two colors meet using a clean, damp brush.

### Negative Painting
Painting around shapes to define them, rather than painting the shapes themselves.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Technique sampler**: Create a chart practicing each technique
2. **Gradient practice**: Make 5 graded washes from different colors
3. **Wet-on-wet exploration**: Let colors mix and see what happens
4. **Layering study**: Build up 3-5 layers to create depth
5. **Texture experiments**: Try salt, dry brush, and splattering on one page

## Tips for Success

- **Let layers dry completely** before adding more paint
- **Use more water than you think** for transparent effects
- **Quality paper matters** - use at least 140lb/300gsm
- **Test colors first** on scrap paper
- **Work light to dark** - you can always add more pigment
- **Embrace happy accidents** - watercolor is meant to flow and surprise

## Remember

There's no "perfect" way to use these techniques. Experiment, play, and discover what works for your style. Every artist develops their own approach over time.
