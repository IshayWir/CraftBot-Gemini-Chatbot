## 💡 Example Interactions

### Starting a Session
**You:** "I'm feeling really stressed from work and just want to relax."  
**Bot:** "I'm glad you're here. Painting can be a wonderful way to decompress. Let's do something calming and meditative—no pressure for perfection. How about a simple gradient exercise? We can work with soothing blues and greens. Just focus on the water moving on the paper..."

### Seeking Next Steps
**You:** "I've practiced gradients and I'm ready for something more challenging."  
**Bot:** "That's wonderful progress! Since you've got gradient control down, let's try a simple sunset landscape. This will practice your gradients plus add layering and basic shape work..."
